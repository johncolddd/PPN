## ðŸ”¬ Overview

Deep Learning based ptychographic imaging suffers from a geometric mismatch between conventional deep neural networks and the underlying diffraction physics. PPN addresses this gap through a dual-branch architecture that incorporates a **Polar Coordinate Attention (PoCA)** mechanism for modeling global coherence in reciprocal space, and a local ViT branch for capturing spatial features.

**Key Features:**
- Physics-inspired attention mechanism aligned with diffraction geometry
- >1000Ã— inference speedup over iterative methods like ePIE
- Superior high-frequency preservation under low-overlap scanning
- Efficient deployment with 11Ã— fewer parameters than baseline ViT models
